# NPLAY-Bot

This bot was created specifically for the Discord [server](https://discord.gg/qcpeZQhJf5) of the german YouTuber and Twitch Streamer [NPLAY](https://www.youtube.com/nplay). The core feature of this bot is a leveling system, similar to Mee6, but with a high level of customization. 
In addition, there are various temporary events, a karma system, rewards, permissions and many other useful features.

## Test Server

The bot is in constant development. Join the test [server](https://discord.gg/JYWezvQ) to receive regular updates, make suggestions and test preview versions. This is also the place to get support if you want to host the bot by yourself.

## Installation
Due to the high level of customization, I do not provide a public instance that anyone can invite. However, you can still host your own version of the bot. Therefore, you should have a basic understanding of Docker, PostgresSQL and of course Discord bots in general.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The bot is designed to only run on a single guild. Multiple guilds are *not* supported. 

### 1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Kaktushose/NPLAY-Bot.git
```

### 2. Initial Configuration

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and provide the given values. 

```env
POSTGRES_DB=database
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/database
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
BOT_GUILD=0123456789
BOT_TOKEN=bot_token
```

### 3. Start the bot

Start the bot by running:

```
docker compose up
```

> [!NOTE]
> The default `docker-compose.yml` will also start up Grafana and Watchtower. These services aren't necessary to run the Bot, so feel free to remove them.

### 4. Further Configuration

To make the bot work properly, you now have to populate the Database correctly. 

1. Update the role ids inside the `item_types` and `ranks` table
2. Update the channel ids inside the `bot_settings` table
3. Add your karma vote emojis (e.g. üëç) inside the `karma_settings` table
4. Use the `/rank-config valid-channels add` command to whitelist  channels for the xp system
5. Manage the permissions with the `/permissions role edit` and `/permissions user edit` commands

That's it. The bot is now fully functional. 

## Credits

3. 1Flo3 for testing 
4. MeerBiene for his support and general ideas and for keeping me sane
5. And of course the rest of the NPLAY Discord Team
